# Mono 129
a tool for creating 1-bit games using Lua
mono 129 is inspired by PICO-8 and the graphics of ZX Spectrum
mono 129 is avaliable at https://igorecm.github.io/m129/

PAY ATTENTION!
the entire project will be rewritten from scratch, because it all kinda messy and the canvas-based graphic interface for editor was not a good idea. at this point you can kinda create something using mono 129, but don't expect much from it. after all, it was made for a school project.
